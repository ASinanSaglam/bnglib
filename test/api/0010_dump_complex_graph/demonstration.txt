This test dumps the graph representation of complex

A(b!1).B(a!1,c~0!2).C(b!2)

This is the debug output:

0: m:0
 -> 1: c:0~DONT_CARE!1, connections: 3, 
2: m:1
 -> 3: c:1~DONT_CARE!1, connections: 1, 
 -> 4: c:2~0!2, connections: 6, 
5: m:2
 -> 6: c:3~DONT_CARE!2, connections: 4, 
 

Each elementary molecule type and component type gets a numerical ID:  
 
m:0 == A
m:1 == B
m:2 == C

c:0 == b (in mol type A)
c:1 == a (in mol type B)
c:2 == c (in mol type B)
c:2 == b (in mol type C)

A rewritten form of the graph dump above without component 
states in the form of a coincidence pairs:
vertex index (name) - vertex index 

0(A) - 1
1(b) - 3 
2(B) - 3
3(a) - 1 
4(c) - 6 
5(C) - 6
6(b) - 4


And one more representation without vertex indices:

A-b-a-B-c-C-b
